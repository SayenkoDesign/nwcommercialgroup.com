View the WordPress admin as a specific role, switch between users, temporarily change your capabilities, set default screen settings for roles.

== Description ==

This plugin will add a menu item to your admin bar where you can change your view in the WordPress admin without the need to login with a user that has this role!

If you've selected a user, you can also change this user's preferences; like screen settings on various admin pages.

You can also see the defaults for a role and/or temporarily change your own capabilities.

Through the new "Role defaults" module you can set default screen settings for roles and apply them on users through various bulk actions.

= Overview / Features =

*	Switch to the view of a user to see their capabilities and settings (admins are filtered!)
*	Edit this user's screen preferences and settings
*	Switch to a default view of a role
*	Temporarily change your own capabilities (non-destructively)
*	Do this all without loggin out and easily go back to your own (default) user view!

= Module: Role defaults =

*	Set default screens for roles
*	Apply defaults to a user
*	Apply defaults to all users of a role
*	Apply defaults when registering a new user (in a multisite this is done when a user is added to its first blog)

= Compatibility =

I think this plugin will work with most other plugins though I've found two allready that have their own capability management or have some kind of actions that influence the admin.

Fixed compatibility issues:

*	WooCommerce - removes the admin bar for the roles "customer" and "subscriber". This functionality will stay the same, but when you switch to a view in the admin it will override this setting. (You need the admin bar to switch back to default)

*	Pods - has its own capability management to determine if the current user is an admin or not. I've used the build in capabilities from Pods to determine wether to show the Pods menu when you are in an other view.

*	User Role Editor - Support for multiple roles per user. (since 1.2.2)

*	Genesis Framework (and probably other theme frameworks) - Changed "init" hook to "plugins_loaded" for theme support (since 1.3.3)

= I can't switch back! =

Just add "?reset-view" in the address bar and you're good to go! This will work on all pages as long as you are logged in.

Example: http://www.your.domain/wp-admin/?reset-view

= It's not working! / I found a bug! =

Please let me know through the support and add a plugins and themes list! :)

= Security =

You have nothing to worry about. All the plugin functionality is only run if a user is logged in AND is an administrator.
Only if the above requirements are OK will this plugin do anything.
Your view is stored separately so your user will keep the normal roles and capabilities.
All settings, views, capabilities, etc. are checked before applied.

So basically if your admin users are safe, this plugin will be safe.
Note: if your admin users aren't safe, this plugin is the last one to worry about ;)

= Developer notes =

This plugin will only be usefull for admins (network super admins or regular admins). It will do NOTHING for other roles.

Also keep in mind that switching to users that have equal roles is disabled. (regular admins to regular admins + super admins to super admins)

== Installation ==

Installation of this plugin works like any other plugin out there. Either:

1. Upload the zip file to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

Or search for "View Admin As" via your plugins menu.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= 1. How do I switch to a user? =
Just click on the name!
If the amount of users is more than 10 you can find them under their roles or you can search for them.

= 2. How do I switch to a role? =
Just click the role :)

= 3. How does the capability system work? =
Only the capabilities enabled for your user are shown.
You can deselect the capabilities by clicking on them. When you would like to see the results just click the shiny button on the upper left.

You can also filter the roles by name or select/deselect all capabilities.
Note: When you select/deselect capabilities while you've filtered them only the capabilities shown by your filter are affected!

When you disable a capability that prevents you from viewing a screen, you can reset the view, see item 4.

= 4. I can't switch back! =

Just add "?reset-view" in the address bar and you're good to go! This will work on all pages as long as you are logged in.

Example: http://www.your.domain/wp-admin/?reset-view

= 5. What data is stored for role defaults and how can I change this? =
By default it uses the following filters:

*	admin_color >> The admin color
*	rich_editing >> Enable/Disable rich editing
*	metaboxhidden_%% >> Hidden metaboxes
*	meta-box-order_%% >> Metabox order and locations
*	closedpostboxes_%% >> Hidden post boxes
*	edit_%%_per_page >> Amount of items per page in edit.php pages
*	manage%%columnshidden >> Hidden columns in edit.php pages
*	screen_layout_%% >> Screen layout (number of columns)

Note that the "%%" stands for a wildcard which could be anything.

If you whish to change this:
`add_filter('view_admin_as_role_defaults_meta', 'my_vaa_meta_filter');
function my_vaa_meta_filter( $metakeys ) {
	$metakeys[] = 'new_meta_key'; // Adding a new meta key
	unset( $metakeys['rich_editing'] ); // Removing a new meta key
	return $metakeys;
}`

= 6. I can't find a user! =
Could it be that this user is an equal user to your's? Example: you are both Admins? 
If so, these are filtered. Viewing Admins can only be done when you are a Super Admin within a network installation.

Why? To protect your fellow admin! You have no power over equal users..

If this is not the case, please make sure you aren't overlooking something.
If that is not the case, please contact me! See item 6.

= 7. It's not working! / I found a bug! =

Please let me know through the support and add a plugins and themes list! :)

= 8. Is this plugin safe? Even for production websites? =

You have nothing to worry about. All the plugin functionality is only run if a user is logged in AND is an administrator.
Only if the above requirements are OK will this plugin do anything.
Your view is stored separately so your user will keep the normal roles and capabilities.
All settings, views, capabilities, etc. are checked before applied.

So basically if your admin users are safe, this plugin will be safe.
Note: if your admin users aren't safe, this plugin is the last one to worry about ;)

= 9. Why this plugin? =

I've created this at first for myself since I'm a developer and often need to see the outcome on roles which my clients use.

So, when you are developing a plugin or theme that does anything with roles or capabilities you can use this plugin to easally check if everything works.
No more hassle of creating test users and constantly logging out and in anymore!

This plugin is also usefull to support your clients and/or users. For example; make screen display presets of the edit and overview pages before you let them log in.

3. Admin User view (user: Mr. Random, role: Author)
4. Default dropdown
5. Dropdown when with 10+ users
6. Search users
7. Quickly deselect capabilities
8. Large popup for better overview of capabilities
